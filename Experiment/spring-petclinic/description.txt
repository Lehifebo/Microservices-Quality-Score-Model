Spring Pet-Clinic is a web application for a veterinary practice that allows users to manage pet owner
information and their pets (including names, birth dates and types), schedule and record veterinary visits
with associated diagnoses and treatment details, and view and update veterinarian profiles; it supports
user authentication for administrative staff, keeps track of clinic branches and working hours, enables
searching and filtering of owners and pets, and provides a straightforward UI for registering new pets,
booking appointments, recording visit histories, and generating simple reports on clinic activity.
