Parts Unlimited MRP is a web based manufacturing resource planning application that lets companies
manage the full lifecycle of parts supply, from entering customer orders and converting them into pur-
chase and production work orders, to tracking inventory levels across multiple warehouses and scheduling
factory operations, while monitoring supplier deliveries, adjusting stock both manually and via automated
reorder thresholds, and synchronizing data with external sales channels and internal reporting systems.
Its intuitive dashboard provides real time visibility into order statuses, production queues, inventory alerts
and performance metrics, enabling operations teams to plan capacity, prevent stock-outs and streamline
the end to end supply chain workflow.
